A semi-automated bash+python pipeline to extract, transform, and load data to a Postgres database a tgz file with multiple different files such as csv, tsv, and txt.

- unzipped the tgz file to retrieve multiple files
- Extracted data from the files, csv, tsv, and txt
- concatenate them into one csv file
- transfomed the csv file 
- loaded the transfomed data to Postgres
